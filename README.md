## üì° API Integration

### API Used

- **Polygon.io:**
  - Fetches stock data using the `GET /v3/reference/tickers` endpoint.

### Key Features

- **Backend Search:** Enables searching stocks dynamically while typing.
- **Pagination:** Infinite scrolling supported using the `cursor` parameter.
- **Rate Limiting Handling:** Handles API rate limits gracefully by retrying requests based on API-provided headers.

## üß™ Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses **Husky** and **Lint-Staged** to ensure clean commits. Pre-commit hooks automatically run:

- **ESLint** for linting JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- **Prettier** for formatting all supported file types.

## üåü Features Under the Hood

### API Caching

- Uses **React Query** for efficient data-fetching and caching, minimizing redundant API calls.

### Responsive Design

- Built with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure usability across devices.

### Developer Productivity

- Configured with **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Husky** for clean, maintainable code.

### Testing

- Unit tests ensure critical features like searching, pagination, and error handling work as expected.
